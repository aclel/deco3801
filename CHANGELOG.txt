v0.6 - Week 12 27/10

Server
+ Add GET /api/buoy_instances/id/readings to get all readings for a buoy instance. Can also use ?last=true query parameter to get only the most recent reading. This is used on the web app to populate the info popup.

iOS App
[Release Candidate]
+ Pinging functionality.
+ More info now displays buoy name, group and creation date.
+ Ability to automatically load some command names and sensor types before making proper requests.
* Updated colours a little (again).
* More info dialog now displays text formattedly rather than as-is.
! More info text escaping bounds when loaded.
! Incorrect names for some groups.
! Some odd edge cases where UI could faff up.

v0.5 - Week 11 20/10

Server:
! Fix GET /api/buoy_groups/id/buoy_instances and GET /api/buoys/id/buoy_instances HTTP error 500
* Buoys and Buoy Groups are now archived instead of deleted. This removes them from the interface but they remain in the database.
+ Add DELETE /api/sensor_types/id - just archives, doesn't do a hard delete
+ When a Buoy acknowledges a set of commands, each command is marked as "sent" and the current time is now recorded as well
+ The time of the last recorded reading is stored in the 'last_recorded' field on a buoy instance sensor
* POST /api/buoys returns the new Buoy in the response
* POST /api/buoys/id/instances has been changed to a batch create
* POST /api/commands and POST /api/buoys/id/commands return the ids of the new commands
* Change format of datetime in POST /buoys/api/readings - date and time are now two separate fields
+ Add altitude, speed OG and course to readings
+ Add /buoys/api/readings/test to test sending readings to the server from a buoy. Missing buoy instance sensors are added. The reading is not stored.

Web App:
* Dashboard panels are now slightly transparent
+ Display a chart for each sensor
* Change charts to scatter charts
* Fix chart timestamp formatting
* Disable chart animation
+ Charts with a lot of readings will display averages instead (and this is indicated clearly)
* Improve graph pane toggling functionality
* Update Export Data to download a zip containing CSVs
* Improve navigation bar styling
+ Export button now dynamically updates to show how many readings from how many buoys will be exported
* Restructure Admin page MVC setup (use separate controllers for each tab)
* Fix sensor types on Admin page
+ Automatically focus on form input when begin editing
+ Press Enter to submit edit change, Escape to cancel editing
+ Implement change password functionality
+ Prompt user to change password on first login
* Update name to 'WaterWatcher'
! Fix bug where changing sensor filters didn't update filtered readings
* Disable randomisation of marker position on map
* Initially only display a marker for the most recent reading for each buoy instance. When a marker is clicked, markers will be shown for older readings for that buoy
! Properly assign colours to buoy instances when they're queried, make them persistent across filter updates, and use the colour for map marker
+ Display buoy instance colours in the list on the filter pane
* Don't display archived sensors in dashboard filter list
* Marker opacity is now based on the relative age of the reading for that buoy, not the time filters
! Fix buoys list not being update correctly when changing time filters


iOS App:
+ 'Unlisted Buoys' section.
+ Basic ping command handling.
* Updated app name.
! Some issues where data model updates could negatively affect UI.

v0.4 - Week 10 13/10

Deployment:
+ A new VPS can now be setup very easily. Docker is being used for deployment. After cloning the source and copying the SSL certificates onto the VPS, it's just a matter of running one command in terminal. This runs the Go server, mysql database, and phpmyadmin, all behind an NGINX reverse proxy.
+ HTTPS is live, and it only applies to some routes. Buoys will be communicating over HTTP, while the web app and iOS app will be communicating over HTTPS.

Server:
! Change GET /api/export?readings to POST /api/readings/export to fix "request url is too long" bug
+ The Go server now runs two HTTP servers, one for the web app and iOS app, and another for all requests that come from the buoy
! GET /api/readings now properly returns readings with timestamp in ascending order, within a buoy instance, within a buoy group
* Json Web Token authentication now uses HMAC instead of RSA. FMS_PUBLIC_KEY and FMS_PRIVATE key are no longer needed.
* GET /api/buoy_instances?active=true now also return buoy instances that have no readings
* Condense JSON on POST /buoys/api/readings to reduce memory load on buoy microcontroller
+ Add GET/buoys/api/commands?guid=test for the Buoy to retrieve "unsent" commands. This returns a lightweight custom CSV format instead of JSON to reduce memory load on the buoy microcontrolelr
+ Add POST /buoys/commands/ack for the Buoy to tell the server which commands have been applied

Web App:
* Major styling changes - spacing, font sizes, colours, inputs, buttons, popups, etc.
! Fix password reset submit form.
! Fix bugs when updating filters and displaying markers.
* Charts pane can be minimised.
+ Implement basic chart functionality.
+ Implement sensor type configuration on Admin page.
* Allow editing of buoys on Admin page.

iOS App:
* App is now called FlounderMobile, to be consistent with the web application.
* New icon.
* Uses HTTPS communications with server, removing need for insecure workaround key.
+ More info dialog when buoys are pressed, containing specific data and buoy commands; window is able to size automatically to updates.
* Significant changes to interface colours and shapes to be more consistent with the web app.
+ Filters for buoy groups, allowing users to narrow the overall list of results.
* Updated JSON handling to future-proof against server changes.
! Some minor interface issues.
! Colours being inverted for buoy marker groups.
! Filters breaking interface when many groups are loaded at once.

v0.3 - Week 9 6/10
Server:
+ Add Apache logging for web requests
+ Add POST /api/users/id/change_password - Can now change user password through the api

+ Add POST /api/sensor_types - Can now add sensor types through the api
+ Add PUT /api/sensor_types/id - Can now update a sensor type through the api
+ Add lower bound and upper bound fields to sensor type
! Fixed problem where decimals were maxing out at 999.999 in the database
! Fixed problem where GET /api/buoy_instances?active=true was returning duplicate instances

iOS App:
* Support for iOS 9. Our app is now able to support devices using both 8 and 9.
+ Missing error messages for internet disconnection and loss of location information.
+ Missing error message for connection failure for buoy information
+ App now loads buoy information from the server with authorization.
* Map markers now show colour depending upon their associated group. These markers are animated and generally pretty cool.

v0.2 - Week 8 22/9
Server:
* Readings table has been split into two tables, "reading" and "sensor_reading". A reading has many sensor readings. When a "reading" is taken the buoy checks its sensors at the same time, so we can assume that the latitude, longitude and timestamp are all going to be the same for each "sensor_reading".

* All SQL queries related to readings have been updated to reflect the changes to the readings in the database.

! GET /api/warnings now properly returns all warnings for warning triggers that have been satisfied. The old implementation used to only check if a warning trigger was satisfied for ONE sensor from the most recent reading for each active buoy instance. This has been corrected so now warning triggers are checked against EVERY sensor in the most recent reading for each active buoy instance.

* GET /api/buoy_instances?active_true now also returns the last known location for a buoy instance. This will be used by the iOS app to display the buoys on the map.

iOS app:
+ Added 'Remember me' option to login screen for email/password.
+ Added settings screen plus a button to access it.
+ Added server address option to settings screen, specifying which server to connect to.
! Fixed issue where connecting to nonexistent server froze app.

Web app:
* Change font to Lato
* Change navbar colour to an aqua-blue
* Increase size of the map on the Dashboard
! Fix alignment issues on Filters on the Dashboard
